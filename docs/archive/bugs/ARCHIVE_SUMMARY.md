## Issue Resolution

### Problem
Rich text editor fields displayed multiple duplicate toolbars instead of a single toolbar, making the application unusable for editing test cases.

### Root Cause
Each CustomQuillEditor component was creating exactly 2 toolbar instances due to multiple Quill.js initializations caused by dependency array changes.

### Final Solution
The issue was resolved through a component-level fix in `frontend/src/components/ui/CustomQuillEditor.jsx`:

1. **Empty Dependency Array**: Changed from `[theme, readOnly, placeholder]` to `[]` to prevent re-initialization
2. **Initialization Guard**: Added check to prevent multiple initializations
3. **Proper Cleanup**: Enhanced cleanup with proper ref handling
4. **Separate Effects**: Used separate useEffect for dynamic updates

### Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The duplicate toolbars issue has been completely fixed and the application is now fully functional for test case editing.

### Verification Results (July 2025)
**Test Date**: July 26, 2025  
**Test URL**: `http://192.168.4.121:3000/testcases/430`  
**Test Method**: Browser automation with DOM analysis and functional testing

#### Test Results:
- **DOM Analysis**: 16 toolbars for 16 rich text containers (1:1 ratio) ✅
- **Visual Inspection**: No duplicate toolbars visible ✅
- **Functional Testing**: All toolbar buttons working correctly ✅
- **User Experience**: Clean, professional interface ✅

#### Technical Verification:
```javascript
// DOM Analysis Results:
{
  "totalToolbars": 16,
  "totalContainers": 16,
  "duplicateAnalysis": [
    // All 16 containers have exactly 1 toolbar each
    {"containerIndex": 0, "toolbarCount": 1, "hasDuplicates": false},
    // ... all containers show toolbarCount: 1, hasDuplicates: false
  ],
  "hasDuplicates": false
}
```

**Conclusion**: The fix is working perfectly. No duplicate toolbars found in any rich text editor field.
