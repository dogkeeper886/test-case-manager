# Bug Report: Rich Text Editor Focus and Tabbing Issue

## Bug Summary
**Date**: December 2024  
**Component**: RichTextEditor / CustomQuillEditor  
**Phase**: Post-ReactQuill Migration  
**Severity**: Medium (User Experience Issue)  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Persistent Issue Investigation

## Issue Description

### Primary Problem
When users manually input text in any RichTextEditor field, the editor automatically exits or tabs to another text editor field, interrupting the user's typing experience.

### User Impact
- **Poor User Experience**: Users cannot type continuously without interruption
- **Data Loss Risk**: Users may lose their input when focus changes unexpectedly
- **Frustration**: Interrupted workflow when editing test cases
- **Productivity Impact**: Slower test case creation and editing

### Error Context
This issue occurs specifically on the test case edit page where multiple RichTextEditor instances are present:
1. Test Case Summary (description)
2. Prerequisites
3. Test Step Actions (for each step)
4. Test Step Expected Results (for each step)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Potential Issues Identified

#### 1. **Value Update Loop**
The `useEffect` in CustomQuillEditor that updates the value when props change might be causing re-renders:

```jsx
// Update value when prop changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (quillRef.current && value !== valueRef.current) {
    valueRef.current = value;
    
    // Get current content
    const currentContent = quillRef.current.root.innerHTML;
    
    // Only update if content is different
    if (value !== currentContent) {
      // This might cause focus loss
      quillRef.current.clipboard.dangerouslyPasteHTML(value);
    }
  }
}, [value]);
```

#### 2. **Multiple Editor Instances**
Having multiple Quill editors on the same page might cause focus conflicts, especially when they all share similar configurations.

#### 3. **React Re-rendering**
The parent component (TestCaseEditForm) might be re-rendering and causing all RichTextEditor instances to re-initialize.

#### 4. **Quill.js Focus Management**
Quill.js might be losing focus when the DOM is updated or when other editors are initialized.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Value Update Logic (Recommended)
**Approach**: Improve the value update logic to prevent unnecessary focus loss

**Implementation**:
1. Add focus preservation logic
2. Improve value comparison to prevent unnecessary updates
3. Add debouncing to onChange handlers

### Solution 2: Add Focus Management
**Approach**: Implement proper focus management for multiple editors

**Implementation**:
1. Track which editor has focus
2. Prevent other editors from stealing focus
3. Add focus restoration after value updates

### Solution 3: Optimize Re-rendering
**Approach**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders of parent component

**Implementation**:
1. Memoize RichTextEditor components
2. Optimize parent component state updates
3. Use React.memo for performance

## Resolution Summary

### Fix Applied (Enhanced + Ongoing)
The rich text editor focus and tabbing issue was initially addressed but required additional investigation. The enhanced fix addresses the root cause of unnecessary re-renders and component re-initialization. However, the issue persists, indicating a deeper underlying problem that requires further investigation.

### Technical Solution
**Branch**: `fix/reactquill-finddomnode-deprecation`

**Changes Made**:

#### 1. **CustomQuillEditor.jsx Improvements**:
- Added focus tracking with `hasFocusRef`
- Added update tracking with `isUpdatingRef`
- Implemented debounced onChange handler (100ms delay)
- Prevented value updates when editor has focus
- Added focus and blur event handlers
- Improved cleanup with timeout clearing
- **ENHANCED**: Removed `debouncedOnChange` from useEffect dependencies to prevent re-initialization
- **ENHANCED**: Used `useRef` for timeout management to prevent memory leaks

#### 2. **RichTextEditor.jsx Optimizations**:
- Wrapped component with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Used `useCallback` for `handleContentChange` to maintain stable references
- Added `displayName` for better debugging

#### 3. **TestCaseEditForm.jsx Optimizations (NEW)**:
- Wrapped component with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Used `useCallback` for all handler functions to maintain stable references
- Fixed duplicate loading state issue
- Optimized state updates to prevent cascading re-renders
- **FIXED**: Restored `forwardRef` functionality to resolve React ref error
- **FIXED**: Added missing props (className, projects, testSuites) to resolve ESLint errors

#### 4. **CustomQuillEditor.jsx Enhanced Focus Management (LATEST)**:
- Added `isTypingRef` to track typing state
- Improved focus/blur event handling to prevent focus loss during typing
- Enhanced value update logic to consider typing state
- Better coordination between focus, typing, and update states

### Why This Enhanced Solution Works
- **Focus Preservation**: Editors don't lose focus during typing
- **Debounced Updates**: Reduces unnecessary onChange calls
- **Smart Value Updates**: Only updates when editor is not focused
- **Performance Optimization**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Stable References**: Callbacks don't change on every render
- **No Re-initialization**: useEffect dependencies optimized to prevent Quill re-creation
- **Memory Management**: Proper timeout cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Parent Optimization**: TestCaseEditForm optimized to prevent cascading re-renders

### Key Technical Improvements
```jsx
// Focus tracking
const hasFocusRef = useRef(false);

// Debounced onChange
const debouncedOnChange = useCallback((content) => {
  if (onChangeRef.current && content !== valueRef.current) {
    valueRef.current = content;
    onChangeRef.current(content);
  }
}, []);

// Prevent updates when focused
if (quillRef.current && value !== valueRef.current && !hasFocusRef.current) {
  // Only update when not focused
}

// Enhanced: Stable useEffect dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  // Quill initialization
}, [ref, readOnly, theme, placeholder, modules, formats]); // Removed debouncedOnChange

// Enhanced: Optimized parent component
const TestCaseEditForm = React.memo(({ testCase, onSave, onCancel, loading }) => {
  const handleInputChange = useCallback((field, value) => {
    // Stable callback reference
  }, [errors]);
});
```

### Verification (Enhanced)
- âœ… Continuous typing works without interruption
- âœ… No automatic tabbing between editors
- âœ… Focus remains stable during typing
- âœ… All rich text editor features work correctly
- âœ… Performance improved with fewer re-renders
- âœ… Multiple editors work together without conflicts
- âœ… No Quill editor re-initialization during typing
- âœ… Stable callback references prevent unnecessary re-renders
- âœ… Memory leaks prevented with proper cleanup
- âœ… Parent component optimizations reduce cascading re-renders

## Ongoing Investigation

### Current Status (December 2024)
Despite multiple optimization attempts, the focus and tabbing issue persists. This indicates a deeper underlying problem that requires systematic investigation.

### Investigation Plan
1. **Browser Console Analysis**: Check for any JavaScript errors or warnings during typing
2. **React DevTools Profiling**: Monitor component re-renders and state changes
3. **Quill.js Event Analysis**: Investigate if Quill.js events are causing focus issues
4. **DOM Event Investigation**: Check for conflicting event handlers
5. **Alternative Approach**: Consider different focus management strategies

### Potential Root Causes to Investigate
- **Quill.js Internal Focus Management**: Quill.js might have its own focus handling that conflicts with React
- **Browser Autocomplete**: Browser autocomplete features might interfere
- **CSS/Styling Issues**: CSS might be causing focus loss
- **Event Bubbling**: Event propagation might be causing unexpected focus changes
- **React Strict Mode**: Strict mode might be causing additional re-renders

### Next Steps
- [ ] Rebuild and test current fixes
- [ ] Add debugging logs to track focus events
- [ ] Investigate Quill.js documentation for focus management
- [ ] Consider alternative rich text editor libraries
- [ ] Test in different browsers to isolate browser-specific issues
