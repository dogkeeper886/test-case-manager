# Test Case Detail Page Enhancement Todo

## Overview
Enhance the test case detail page to improve the testing flow and user experience by reorganizing content hierarchy and improving the visual presentation of test steps.

## Requirements Analysis

### Current State
- Test case detail page has 3 tabs: Overview, Test Steps, Custom Fields
